This book is structured to follow the stages of a typical career path for an engineer who ends up becoming a manager
Hands-on expertise is what gives you credibility and what helps you make decisions and lead your team effectively.

# I - Management 101
> [!quote] Casey Stengel
> The secret of managing is keeping the people who hate you away from the ones who haven’t made up their minds.

* neglectful managers who ignore you when you need help and brush your concerns aside, avoid meeting with you, never give you feedback
* micromanagers who question every detail of everything you do and refuse to let you make any decisions on your own
* actively abusive managers who neglect you until they want to yell at you for something

* Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career
* Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback.
* Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn
* Managers who want you to take their job someday
* managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus.

## What to Expect from a Manager
### ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS
* create human connection. Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes
* regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing
Being an introvert is not an excuse for making no effort to treat people like real human. Human connection lead to trust.
Real trust, requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other
expect your 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability
share the responsibility of having good 1-1s with your manager

### FEEDBACK AND WORKPLACE GUIDANCE
not just talking about performance reviews
you will screw up in some fashion, and if your manager is any good she will let you know quickly that you did
only thing worse than getting behavioral feedback is not getting it at all
The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct. This also goes for getting praise. Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something

Ideally, the feedback you get from your manager will be somewhat public if it’s praise, and private if it’s criticism

There are other types of feedback that you may want to ask for from your manager (code review, presentation content, doc, ...)
Asking your manager for advice is also a good way to show that you respect her

When it comes to your role at the company, your manager needs to be your number one ally
* ask what areas you need to focus on to get promoted
* help you get to resolution with teammate or a person on another team
If you don’t ask your manager, do not expect magically

shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team’s goals
helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work

As you become more senior, the amount of personal feedback you get, both good and bad, is likely to decrease. Expect the type of feedback to change somewhat from personal feedback to team- or strategy-related input.

### TRAINING AND CAREER GROWTH
manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for career growth
for the most part, for figuring out what types of training you want
The other way your manager will contribute very directly to your career growth is via promotion and, probably, compensation

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Big Ambitions
> my career goal is to someday become a CTO myself.
> seek out a workplace where you can get mentorship and training in the aspects of doing the job as well as learn new technical skills
> find the best managers and mentors you can, and watch them work
> create and build a strong network of peers

## How to Be Managed
Part of being a good manager is figuring out how to be managed

### SPEND TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT
You’ll probably go through periods of career uncertainty in your life
Use your manager to discover what’s possible where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next.

### YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELF
Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want
Advocate for yourself, Seek out feedback,
When you are persistently unhappy, say something. When you are stuck, ask for help. When you want a raise, ask for it. When you want a promotion,  find out what you need to do to get it.

Your manager cannot force work–life balance on you. Sometimes you will have to go against the cultural grain to set your own boundaries

You will not get everything you ask for, and asking is not usually a fun or comfortable experience. However, it’s the fastest way forward

### GIVE YOUR MANAGER A BREAK
Her job is to do the best thing for the company and the team. It is not to do whatever it takes to make you happy all the time.
The only person you can change is yourself. You should absolutely provide feedback to your manager, but understand that she may not listen or change no matter how much you think she should

f you  find yourself starting to actively resent your manager for whatever reason, you probably need to move to a different team or look for a new job.
If you  find yourself resenting every manager you work for, you may need to think about whether the cause is them or you

Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems.

### CHOOSE YOUR MANAGERS WISELY
Strong managers know how to play the game at their company. They can get you promoted; they can get you attention and feedback from important people. Strong managers have strong networks, and they can get you jobs even after you stop working for them.

There’s a difference between a strong manager and a manager that you like as a friend, or even one you respect as an engineer.

## Assessing Your Own Experience
Have you had a manager you considered good? 
What did this manager do that you found valuable?
How often do you meet 1-1 with your manager? 
Do you come to 1-1s with your manager bringing topics to discuss?
If your 1-1 is a status meeting, can you use some other means to convey that status?
Do you feel that you can tell your manager when you have a major life event?
Do you feel that your manager knows something about you personally?
Has your manager delivered good feedback to you?
Bad feedback?
Any feedback at all?
Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this year?

# II - Mentoring
The  first act of people management for many engineers is often unofficial. They  find themselves, through the luck of the draw, mentoring someone.

## The Importance of Mentoring to Junior Team Members
In a healthy organization, this onboarding mentorship role is used as an opportunity for both parties. The mentor gets the chance to see what it is like to have responsibility for another person, and the mentee gets an overseer who is focused on him alone, without other reports clamoring for his mentor’s attention

## Being a Mentor
This is an experience that not everyone will get: an opportunity to learn in a fairly safe way about the job of management, and the feeling of being responsible for another person
It’s unlikely that you’ll get  fired for being a bad mentor

the worst that can happen is that 
* the mentee is a drain on their time and they get less coding work done
* they do such a poor job that the mentee doesn’t join the organization, or opts to leave the organization

Great talent is sometimes squandered by weak mentors who
* do little but ignore their charges
* waste their time with trivial projects
* worst of all, intimidate and belittle them out of ever wanting to join the organization

### MENTORING AN INTERN
realistic to expect that the candidate will 
* know very little
* probably go elsewhere next year for his internship unless he has an amazing experience. No pressure.

The  first thing you need is some sort of project for this intern to work on. Or at least look at small features of your own current project that would take you a few days to complete, and start there.

Sit with him as much as possible these  first few days. Get him started installing the IDE and checking out the code. Touch base several times a day to make sure he’s not feeling lost or overwhelmed by the volume of new information

spend a little time in the  first few days of the intern’s tenure breaking his project down. Walk through the breakdown with your intern. Does it make sense to him?

you’re practicing skills that you will need should you decide in the future to become a manager. these skills are listening, communicating what needs to happen, and adjusting to his responses.

#### listen carefully
Listening is a precursor to empathy, which is one of the core skills of a quality manager.

One of the early lessons in leadership, whether it is via direct management or indirect influence, is that people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand.
Be prepared to say anything complex a few times, in different ways.
If you feel that you don’t understand something your mentee has asked you, repeat the question in a different way. Let him correct you.
Use those whiteboards

And remember that you’re in a position of huge power in your mentee’s eyes
Make your life easier and get those questions out of him. The odds of you spending all of your time answering questions are slim compared to the odds that your intern will go off in the absolute wrong direction because he didn’t ask enough questions.

#### Clearly communicate
what if the intern does spend too much time asking you for help, without ever looking for help himself?

what if the intern does spend too much time asking you for help, without ever looking for help himself?
if he can’t do it even with pointers, well, you’re starting to learn something about the potential of this intern. If all else fails, give him the  first milestone of the project and tell him to work on it alone for a day or two

#### Calibrate your response
nal management skill for you to practice: adjusting to the intern’s responses

In the rst few weeks of the internship, you’re learning the frequency that you need to check in with him to provide the right adjustments.
I would recommend trying to check in once a week regardless, and spending any extra time as an additional interview/sell cycle for the company.

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Mentoring a Summer Intern
> 1. prepare for his arrival (date, access, funitures,...)
> 2. have a project for him to work on. Clear project, specific and not urgent, relevant. take the time for an entry level engineer, give the intern twice the time. He’s still in school and still learning, so expect him to move slowly, and be pleasantly surprised if he overshoots
> 3. Plan to have him present the work he did at the end of the program. This helps him get exposure beyond you and the other mentors, and gives him the clear expectation that you want him to finish a project
> 
> interns who feel like the company appreciated their work are the ones most likely to come back after they graduate.

### MENTORING A NEW HIRE
Mentoring new hires is critical. can be an easier job than mentoring an intern, but the relationship and mentoring will usually go on for a lot longer.
What are the rules, spoken and unspoken?
Eective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires. Things like step-by-step guides t

Part of the mentoring opportunity here is the chance to introduce the new person around. Companies are full of human networks that exist to transmit knowledge and information quickly. Bringing this person into some of your networks will help her get up to speed faster, and it will give you a new entree into whatever networks she ends up forming and joining in her time with the company.

The workplace is built around humans and their interactions, and these networks form the basis of any career, whether it’s focused around management or individual technical contributions
conscious eort and practice in getting to know new people and helping them succeed will pay o
Adopt the mindset that network building is a worthwhile investment of your time and energy.

### TECHNICAL OR CAREER MENTORING
This type of mentoring is usually not directly related to the path of management.

#### When you are a mentor
Tell your mentee what you expect from him. If you want him to come prepared for your meetings with questions he has sent you in advance, ask for that.
Be explicit about your time commitment. And then be honest with him when he asks questions. There’s no point in being a mentor to a relative stranger

It’s also OK to say no to mentoring. Sometimes you can feel obligated to say yes to every person who asks you for help, but your time is valuable
Don’t do it unless you think it will be rewarding for you and the person you’re mentoring. 

#### When you are a mentee
Think about what you want to get out of this relationship, and come prepared to your sessions. You owe it to this person not to waste her time.

Sometimes we end up with mentors because someone thinks we should have them, You don’t have to have a mentor. Maybe instead you need a friend, or a therapist, or a coach.

It can be easy to undervalue your mentor’s time, because you usually aren’t paying for it

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Alpha Geek
The alpha geek is driven to be the best engineer on the team, to always have the right answer, and to be the person who solves all the hard problems. The alpha geek values intelligence and technical skill above all other traits, usually can’t deal with dissent, and is easily threatened by those she perceives as trying to steal her spotlight or who might upstage her
She believes herself to be the best, and responds only to messages that support that view. The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence, but ends up creating a culture of fear

The alpha geek is usually an excellent, eective engineer who goes into management either because she was pushed into it or because she believes that the smartest person on the team should be the manager. Sometimes the alpha geek will take credit for all of the work that a team does rather than acknowledging the strength of the team members.

At their best, alpha geeks can be inspirational to younger developers, even though they seem very intimidating.
At their worst, alpha geeks can’t let anyone else get any glory without claiming some of it for themselves. They are the origin of any good ideas but had no part in creating the bad ideas, except that he knew they would fail.

The alpha geek habit often starts to show up when engineers rst become mentors. If you have ever wondered why people don’t seem to come to you for help despite your clearly strong technical skills, ask yourself whether you’re showing some signs of being an alpha geek

fighting hard for what you believe to be correct? If you suspect that you may be an alpha geek, mentoring can be a great opportunity to break out of that habit.
Practicing the art of teaching can help us learn how to nurture and coach.if you’re unwilling to change your style to help a mentee succeed, please don’t volunteer to be a mentor!

Alpha geeks make absolutely terrible managers, unless they can learn to let go of their identity as the smartest person in the room and most technical person on the team

The alpha geek culture can be very harmful to collaboration and can deeply undermine those who feel unable to ght back.

## Tips for the Manager of a Mentor
What you measure, you improve. As a manager you help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals. So often, we fail to apply this basic wisdom to the process of assigning mentors, but it applies here as much as anywhere else

### why you are setting up this mentoring relationship ?
often the mentor and mentee are given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together. Most of the time, these programs yield very little to either party

### recognize that this is an additional responsibility for the mentor
common mentoring pitfalls include viewing it as a low-status “emotional labor” position. Emotional labor is a way to think about traditionally feminine “soft skills”— that is, skills that address the emotional needs of people and team. It’s assumed to be something that should just be provided without (nancial) recognition
they need to be recognized for the work they put in

### use this opportunity to reward and train future leaders on your team.
Brilliant, introverted developers may not ever want to formally manage, but encouraging them to mentor 1-1 helps them develop stronger external perspectives,
an impatient young engineer may nd a degree of humility when tasked with helping an intern succeed (under your supervision).

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Hiring Interns
> increase hiring pipeline and find strong candidates before they graduate. not hire interns who will do a lot of work for the company
> 1. Don’t hire interns who are not going to graduate in the year after their internship.
> 2. • Hiring interns is relatively easy compared to hiring full-time graduates

## Key Takeaways for the Mentor
### BE CURIOUS AND OPEN-MINDED
