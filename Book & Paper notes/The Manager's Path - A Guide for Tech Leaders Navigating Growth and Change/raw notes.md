This book is structured to follow the stages of a typical career path for an engineer who ends up becoming a manager
Hands-on expertise is what gives you credibility and what helps you make decisions and lead your team effectively.

# I - Management 101
> [!quote] Casey Stengel
> The secret of managing is keeping the people who hate you away from the ones who haven’t made up their minds.

* neglectful managers who ignore you when you need help and brush your concerns aside, avoid meeting with you, never give you feedback
* micromanagers who question every detail of everything you do and refuse to let you make any decisions on your own
* actively abusive managers who neglect you until they want to yell at you for something

* Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career
* Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback.
* Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn
* Managers who want you to take their job someday
* managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus.
* 
## What to Expect from a Manager
### ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS
* create human connection. Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes
* regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing
Being an introvert is not an excuse for making no effort to treat people like real human. Human connection lead to trust.
Real trust, requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other
expect your 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability
share the responsibility of having good 1-1s with your manager

### FEEDBACK AND WORKPLACE GUIDANCE
not just talking about performance reviews
you will screw up in some fashion, and if your manager is any good she will let you know quickly that you did
only thing worse than getting behavioral feedback is not getting it at all
The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct. This also goes for getting praise. Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something

Ideally, the feedback you get from your manager will be somewhat public if it’s praise, and private if it’s criticism

There are other types of feedback that you may want to ask for from your manager (code review, presentation content, doc, ...)
Asking your manager for advice is also a good way to show that you respect her

When it comes to your role at the company, your manager needs to be your number one ally
* ask what areas you need to focus on to get promoted
* help you get to resolution with teammate or a person on another team
If you don’t ask your manager, do not expect magically

shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team’s goals
helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work

As you become more senior, the amount of personal feedback you get, both good and bad, is likely to decrease. Expect the type of feedback to change somewhat from personal feedback to team- or strategy-related input.

### TRAINING AND CAREER GROWTH
manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for career growth
for the most part, for figuring out what types of training you want
The other way your manager will contribute very directly to your career growth is via promotion and, probably, compensation

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Big Ambitions
> my career goal is to someday become a CTO myself.
> seek out a workplace where you can get mentorship and training in the aspects of doing the job as well as learn new technical skills
> find the best managers and mentors you can, and watch them work
> create and build a strong network of peers

## How to Be Managed
Part of being a good manager is figuring out how to be managed

### SPEND TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT
You’ll probably go through periods of career uncertainty in your life
Use your manager to discover what’s possible where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next.

### YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELF
Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want
Advocate for yourself, Seek out feedback,
When you are persistently unhappy, say something. When you are stuck, ask for help. When you want a raise, ask for it. When you want a promotion,  find out what you need to do to get it.

Your manager cannot force work–life balance on you. Sometimes you will have to go against the cultural grain to set your own boundaries

You will not get everything you ask for, and asking is not usually a fun or comfortable experience. However, it’s the fastest way forward

### GIVE YOUR MANAGER A BREAK
Her job is to do the best thing for the company and the team. It is not to do whatever it takes to make you happy all the time.
The only person you can change is yourself. You should absolutely provide feedback to your manager, but understand that she may not listen or change no matter how much you think she should

f you  find yourself starting to actively resent your manager for whatever reason, you probably need to move to a different team or look for a new job.
If you  find yourself resenting every manager you work for, you may need to think about whether the cause is them or you

Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems.

### CHOOSE YOUR MANAGERS WISELY
Strong managers know how to play the game at their company. They can get you promoted; they can get you attention and feedback from important people. Strong managers have strong networks, and they can get you jobs even after you stop working for them.

There’s a difference between a strong manager and a manager that you like as a friend, or even one you respect as an engineer.

## Assessing Your Own Experience
Have you had a manager you considered good? 
What did this manager do that you found valuable?
How often do you meet 1-1 with your manager? 
Do you come to 1-1s with your manager bringing topics to discuss?
If your 1-1 is a status meeting, can you use some other means to convey that status?
Do you feel that you can tell your manager when you have a major life event?
Do you feel that your manager knows something about you personally?
Has your manager delivered good feedback to you?
Bad feedback?
Any feedback at all?
Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this year?

# II - Mentoring
The  first act of people management for many engineers is often unofficial. They  find themselves, through the luck of the draw, mentoring someone.

## The Importance of Mentoring to Junior Team Members
In a healthy organization, this onboarding mentorship role is used as an opportunity for both parties. The mentor gets the chance to see what it is like to have responsibility for another person, and the mentee gets an overseer who is focused on him alone, without other reports clamoring for his mentor’s attention

## Being a Mentor
This is an experience that not everyone will get: an opportunity to learn in a fairly safe way about the job of management, and the feeling of being responsible for another person
It’s unlikely that you’ll get  fired for being a bad mentor

the worst that can happen is that 
* the mentee is a drain on their time and they get less coding work done
* they do such a poor job that the mentee doesn’t join the organization, or opts to leave the organization

Great talent is sometimes squandered by weak mentors who
* do little but ignore their charges
* waste their time with trivial projects
* worst of all, intimidate and belittle them out of ever wanting to join the organization

### MENTORING AN INTERN
realistic to expect that the candidate will 
* know very little
* probably go elsewhere next year for his internship unless he has an amazing experience. No pressure.

The  first thing you need is some sort of project for this intern to work on. Or at least look at small features of your own current project that would take you a few days to complete, and start there.

Sit with him as much as possible these  first few days. Get him started installing the IDE and checking out the code. Touch base several times a day to make sure he’s not feeling lost or overwhelmed by the volume of new information

spend a little time in the  first few days of the intern’s tenure breaking his project down. Walk through the breakdown with your intern. Does it make sense to him?

you’re practicing skills that you will need should you decide in the future to become a manager. these skills are listening, communicating what needs to happen, and adjusting to his responses.

#### listen carefully
Listening is a precursor to empathy, which is one of the core skills of a quality manager.

One of the early lessons in leadership, whether it is via direct management or indirect influence, is that people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand.
Be prepared to say anything complex a few times, in different ways.
If you feel that you don’t understand something your mentee has asked you, repeat the question in a different way. Let him correct you.
Use those whiteboards

And remember that you’re in a position of huge power in your mentee’s eyes
Make your life easier and get those questions out of him. The odds of you spending all of your time answering questions are slim compared to the odds that your intern will go off in the absolute wrong direction because he didn’t ask enough questions.

#### Clearly communicate
what if the intern does spend too much time asking you for help, without ever looking for help himself?

what if the intern does spend too much time asking you for help, without ever looking for help himself?
if he can’t do it even with pointers, well, you’re starting to learn something about the potential of this intern. If all else fails, give him the  first milestone of the project and tell him to work on it alone for a day or two

#### Calibrate your response
final management skill for you to practice: adjusting to the intern’s responses

In the first few weeks of the internship, you’re learning the frequency that you need to check in with him to provide the right adjustments.
I would recommend trying to check in once a week regardless, and spending any extra time as an additional interview/sell cycle for the company.

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Mentoring a Summer Intern
> 1. prepare for his arrival (date, access, funitures,...)
> 2. have a project for him to work on. Clear project, specific and not urgent, relevant. take the time for an entry level engineer, give the intern twice the time. He’s still in school and still learning, so expect him to move slowly, and be pleasantly surprised if he overshoots
> 3. Plan to have him present the work he did at the end of the program. This helps him get exposure beyond you and the other mentors, and gives him the clear expectation that you want him to finish a project
> 
> interns who feel like the company appreciated their work are the ones most likely to come back after they graduate.

### MENTORING A NEW HIRE
Mentoring new hires is critical. can be an easier job than mentoring an intern, but the relationship and mentoring will usually go on for a lot longer.
What are the rules, spoken and unspoken?
Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires. Things like step-by-step guides t

Part of the mentoring opportunity here is the chance to introduce the new person around. Companies are full of human networks that exist to transmit knowledge and information quickly. Bringing this person into some of your networks will help her get up to speed faster, and it will give you a new entree into whatever networks she ends up forming and joining in her time with the company.

The workplace is built around humans and their interactions, and these networks form the basis of any career, whether it’s focused around management or individual technical contributions
conscious effort and practice in getting to know new people and helping them succeed will pay off
Adopt the mindset that network building is a worthwhile investment of your time and energy.

### TECHNICAL OR CAREER MENTORING
This type of mentoring is usually not directly related to the path of management.

#### When you are a mentor
Tell your mentee what you expect from him. If you want him to come prepared for your meetings with questions he has sent you in advance, ask for that.
Be explicit about your time commitment. And then be honest with him when he asks questions. There’s no point in being a mentor to a relative stranger

It’s also OK to say no to mentoring. Sometimes you can feel obligated to say yes to every person who asks you for help, but your time is valuable
Don’t do it unless you think it will be rewarding for you and the person you’re mentoring. 

#### When you are a mentee
Think about what you want to get out of this relationship, and come prepared to your sessions. You owe it to this person not to waste her time.

Sometimes we end up with mentors because someone thinks we should have them, You don’t have to have a mentor. Maybe instead you need a friend, or a therapist, or a coach.

It can be easy to undervalue your mentor’s time, because you usually aren’t paying for it

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Alpha Geek
The alpha geek is driven to be the best engineer on the team, to always have the right answer, and to be the person who solves all the hard problems. The alpha geek values intelligence and technical skill above all other traits, usually can’t deal with dissent, and is easily threatened by those she perceives as trying to steal her spotlight or who might upstage her
She believes herself to be the best, and responds only to messages that support that view. The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence, but ends up creating a culture of fear

The alpha geek is usually an excellent, effective engineer who goes into management either because she was pushed into it or because she believes that the smartest person on the team should be the manager. Sometimes the alpha geek will take credit for all of the work that a team does rather than acknowledging the strength of the team members.

At their best, alpha geeks can be inspirational to younger developers, even though they seem very intimidating.
At their worst, alpha geeks can’t let anyone else get any glory without claiming some of it for themselves. They are the origin of any good ideas but had no part in creating the bad ideas, except that he knew they would fail.

The alpha geek habit often starts to show up when engineers first become mentors. If you have ever wondered why people don’t seem to come to you for help despite your clearly strong technical skills, ask yourself whether you’re showing some signs of being an alpha geek

fighting hard for what you believe to be correct? If you suspect that you may be an alpha geek, mentoring can be a great opportunity to break out of that habit.
Practicing the art of teaching can help us learn how to nurture and coach.if you’re unwilling to change your style to help a mentee succeed, please don’t volunteer to be a mentor!

Alpha geeks make absolutely terrible managers, unless they can learn to let go of their identity as the smartest person in the room and most technical person on the team

The alpha geek culture can be very harmful to collaboration and can deeply undermine those who feel unable to fight back.

## Tips for the Manager of a Mentor
What you measure, you improve. As a manager you help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals. So often, we fail to apply this basic wisdom to the process of assigning mentors, but it applies here as much as anywhere else

### why you are setting up this mentoring relationship ?
often the mentor and mentee are given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together. Most of the time, these programs yield very little to either party

### recognize that this is an additional responsibility for the mentor
common mentoring pitfalls include viewing it as a low-status “emotional labor” position. Emotional labor is a way to think about traditionally feminine “soft skills”— that is, skills that address the emotional needs of people and team. It’s assumed to be something that should just be provided without (financial) recognition
they need to be recognized for the work they put in

### use this opportunity to reward and train future leaders on your team.
Brilliant, introverted developers may not ever want to formally manage, but encouraging them to mentor 1-1 helps them develop stronger external perspectives,
an impatient young engineer may find a degree of humility when tasked with helping an intern succeed (under your supervision).

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Hiring Interns
> increase hiring pipeline and find strong candidates before they graduate. not hire interns who will do a lot of work for the company
> 1. Don’t hire interns who are not going to graduate in the year after their internship.
> 2. • Hiring interns is relatively easy compared to hiring full-time graduates

## Key Takeaways for the Mentor
### BE CURIOUS AND OPEN-MINDED
Mentoring provides a great opportunity to cultivate curiosity and see the world through fresh eyes
While many people think creativity is about seeing new things, it’s also about seeing patterns that are hidden to others. It’s hard to see patterns when the only data points you have are your own experiences

### LISTEN AND SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE
Mentoring, when done well, starts to shape the skills every future leader needs
practice listening
Senior engineers can develop bad habits, and one of the worst is the tendency to lecture and debate with anyone who does not understand them or who disagrees with what they are saying
you must be able to listen and communicate in a way that person can understand

### MAKE CONNECTIONS
Your career ultimately succeeds or fails on the strength of your network
On the flip side, don’t abuse the mentoring relationship, treat the other person well.

## Assessing Your Own Experience
Here are some questions to consider as you develop this part of your career:
* Does your company have an internship program? If so, can you volunteer to mentor an intern?
* How does your company think about onboarding? Do you assign mentors to new hires? If not, can you propose to your manager that you try doing this, and volunteer to mentor someone?
* Have you ever had a great mentor? What did that person do that made you think he or she was great? How did the mentor help you learn—what did he or she teach you?
* Have you ever had a mentoring relationship that didn’t work out? Why didn’t it work out? What lessons about that experience can you apply to avoid similar failures going forward?

# III - Tech lead
The idea that the tech lead role should automatically be given to the most experienced engineer, the one who can handle the most complex features or who writes the best code, is a common misconception

The tech lead role is not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that any engineer may take on once they reach the senior level. This role may or may not include people management, but if it does, the tech lead is expected to manage these team members to the high management standards of RTR tech. These standards include: 
* Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases 
* Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted 
* Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring 
If a tech lead is not managing directly, they are still expected to provide mentorship and guidance to the other members of the team

strong technical project manager, scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging
They focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to increase the impact of the team’s work product. They are also learning how to partner effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business.

[Talking with Tech Leads](https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads) definition: A leader, responsible for a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time writing code with the team.

people skills are what we’re asking the new tech lead to stretch, much more than pure technical expertise

## Being a Tech Lead
Influencing without authority.
influence my peers, influence up to my manager to ensure we are prioritizing the right work

Becoming a tech lead required me to change my focus. less about working on the most technically challenging idea, more on my team
How do I empower them? How do I remove the obstacles slowing them down?

## All Great Tech Leads Know This One Weird Trick
biggest trick of being a good tech lead: the willingness to step away from the code and figure out how to balance your technical commitments with the work the whole team needs. learn the art of balance.
From now on, wherever you go in your career, balancing is likely to be one of your core challenges. 
What’s worse, you’ll often need to balance doing things you know how to do and enjoy doing, such as writing code, with things you don’t know how to do
You have to stop relying entirely on your old skills and start to learn some new skills.

## Being a Tech Lead 101
### THE MAIN ROLES OF A TECH LEAD
Your highest priority as a tech lead is taking a wide view of the work so that you keep the project moving
* **Systems architect and business analyst**: identify the critical systems that need to change and the critical features that need to be built in order to deliver upcoming projects. have a good sense of the overall architecture of your systems and a solid understanding of how to design complex software. understand business requirements and translate them into software
* **Project planner**: break work down into rough deliverables. getting as much productive work done in parallel as possible. Finding places to apply agreed-upon abstractions to enable parallel work is key. gather input from the experts on your team, start identifying priorities (Which pieces are critical, and which are optional?)
* **Software developer and team leader**: Sometimes tech leads are tempted to go to heroics and push through these obstacles themselves, working excessive overtime to get it all done. you should continue writing code, but not too much. communicate this obstacle first, raising issues early. Teams often fail because they overworked themselves on a feature that their product manager would have been willing to compromise on. delegate work.
Fortunately you don’t have to do all of these tasks at once. It may be uncomfortable at first, but you’ll find a balance with time and practice

> [!question] Ask the CTO: I Hate Being a Tech Lead!
> The Stone of Triumph is a metaphor for achieving recognition only to discover that recognition comes with a heavy price. the tech lead stage is surely one of the heaviest stones
> Very rarely is the tech lead given an increase in salary or a title bump, and first-time tech leads often have no idea how hard the new responsibilities can be
> The tech lead has a much wider scope of responsibility than the senior engineer in an individual contributor position. help architect a project, planning out the work, make sure the team fully understands the project requirements and the team is eective and performing well
> most managers will expect their tech leads to continue to write almost as much code as they did before they took on the lead role
> If you’re a first-time tech lead, you have your hands very full. carrying around that burden will eventually make you stronger and give you skills you need to move forward in your career

## Managing Projects
Doesn’t agile software development get rid of the need for project management? No. it forces you to focus on breaking tasks down into smaller chunks, planning those smaller chunks out, and delivering value incrementally instead of all at once.
Some projects (with words like infrastructure, platform, or system) which includes many unknowns and relatively hard deadlines, you will find it doesn’t fit so well into the standard agile process.

you need to understand how to break down work that has complexity beyond the scope of what you can do as an individual
Project management isn’t something that needs to happen in detail for every single effort, and it’s overused in some organizations. But it has to happen, and as tech lead, you should be doing it when it is needed, especially for deeply technical projects.

the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly, that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future. it’s that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens

### Take the Time to Explain
We think our management “gets” what we do as technologists.
Technology managers hire the best people (hopefully), who solve very dicult problems. But they don’t “get” it all. educates them without making them feel small,

### Managing a Project
1. **Break down the work**. Get the big stuff broken down some, and then turn your attention to the ordering of the work. You don’t actually have to do it all yourself
2. **Push through the details and the unknowns.** Work through the unknowns until you really feel that there is no more value to be gained in spending time on them.
3. **Run the project and adjust the plan as you go.**  As things slip (and they always do), keep everyone apprised of the status
4. **Use the insights gained in the planning process to manage requirements changes.**  be clear about the cost of those changes. if working toward a hard deadline, knowing roughly the effort required will help you prioritize, cut, and simplify work to get the best compromise of features, quality, and delivery date.
5. **Revisit the details as you get close to completion.** What is missing? What testing? What verification? Run a premortem, an exercise where you go through all the things that could fail on the launch of this big project. Decide where the line for “good enough” and commit to it. Make a launch plan; make a rollback plan.

> [!question] Ask the CTO: I’m Not Sure I Want to Be a Tech Lead
> If you’re not ready to take on management-type responsibilities, don’t take them on. 
> At more senior levels people who are considered “not technical enough” can find it hard to be promoted into management positions with more responsibility
> to progress in your career, you’ll probably need to do the tech lead job, even if you’re interested in staying on the individual contributor (nonmanagement) career path. That doesn’t mean you need to do it now.
> If you don’t think the individual work would challenge you technically, perhaps it’s time to push yourself into learning some new skills. the skills of the tech lead are good ones to try out

## Decision Point: Stay on the Technical Track or Become a Manager
### IMAGINED LIFE OF A SENIOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR
Your days are spent in a mix of deep thinking, solving hard problems that challenge you intellectually but are still fun and novel, and collaborating with other deep thinkers.
Because of your seniority, the managers ask you for your advice on how to approach development before it begins, so you know everything that’s going on but you don’t really need to deal with the details of the people building it.
you're invited to just the right set of meetings where the important decisions are made
he more junior developers look up to you and hang on your every word
You get to write books, give talks, and create open source work—and with some luck and persistence, you earn a bit of industry-wide fame.
In short, you have the perfect balance of engaging work, fame, and accumulated expertise that makes you invaluable and respected, highly paid, and influential.

### REAL LIFE OF A SENIOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR
When you find the right project, and the right lifecycle of the right project, your life is great
You have a lot of control over your day-to-day, and certainly fewer meetings than your management counterparts
Your upward trajectory is pretty slow. Those big projects that prove you to be an invaluable architect are hard to find.
Discovering good projects seems to be a matter of luck. Pick the wrong project, and you spend months or even years on something that might get cancelled despite all of your best efforts
The other developers are a mixed bag. some of them admire you and listen to your opinions, but others seem to be jealous of your influence. There’s definitely some competitiveness with your peers around who gets to lead big, interesting projects.

Your manager isn’t terribly supportive of your desire to open source a system because you think it provides a new twist on logging that the industry needs, and she suggests that if you want to give talks or write books perhaps you need to spend some of your personal time on those efforts.

You suspect that you are missing out on crucial information because you aren’t in the right meetings, but every time your manager invites you to sit in those meetings you remember how boring and inefficient they are

Still, you get to build things most of the time. you don’t have to do all that much dealing with people or sitting in boring meetings. You can often choose your projects and can easily move between teams if you want something new. And you just found out that you get paid more than your manager! So, life isn’t all bad.

### IMAGINED LIFE OF A MANAGER
You have a team, you have control, you can make the decisions, and you can finally get others to do things your way.
Because you care about people, they know that you’re always trying to do your best for them even when they disagree with you. You see the impact of your coaching happen quickly now that you are in this position of authority.

Other managers are always interested in hearing what you think, and they can see how effectively you’ve gotten your team working
The minute that you feel ready to take on a bigger team, your manager is open to giving you more people and expanding your organization

In short, you get to make decisions, you create the culture, and your effectiveness is evident to all around you, making your path to promotion quick and your career exciting and lucrative.

### REAL LIFE OF A MANAGER
You have a team. You have some control, but you’ve quickly discovered that getting people to do something is harder than just telling them to do it.
Mostly you spend all day in meetings. you’ve lost touch with the code. Having the focus to build something big yourself is a distant memory.
Realistically, you can maybe narrow down the things that will get decided. You can focus your team on some things
Your manager gives you goals but then sometimes changes those goals completely, and it’s up to you to explain the changes to the team.
Your team does not naturally just agree with you, respect you, or even like you. You realize that authority requires more than a title.
you have to tell individuals that they aren’t ready to be promoted just yet, that they aren’t getting a raise, that there’s no bonus this year
When the company is doing well, and you have lots of money to pay, and there are plenty of exciting projects, life is great; but when things are stressful, you see how little power you have to make people happy. And what’s worse, you can’t even fire people without going through a crazy HR process!
Other managers are not interested in your feedback. In fact, they find you meddling and get competitive when they think you’re encroaching on their turf.

The politics of figuring out how to lead without undermining your peers or your boss are trickier than you expected.
But if you can get that bigger team, you know you will get that promotion, so at least your path is clear.

My final advice is to remember that you can switch tracks if you want. It is common for people to try out management at some point, realize they don’t enjoy it, and go back to the technical track. Nothing about this choice has to be permanent, but go in with your eyes wide open. Each role has benefits and drawbacks, and it’s up to you to feel out what you enjoy the most.

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar
The process czar believes that there is one true process that, if implemented correctly and followed as designed, will solve all of the team’s biggest problems. Process czars may be obsessed with agile, Kanban, scrum, lean, or even waterfall methods.
They can be incredibly valuable members of a project management team because they tend to make sure that no task is forgotten and that everything is wrapped up in the way it should be
Process czars struggle when they fail to realize that most people are not as good at following processes as they are. They tend to blame all problems on a failure to follow the best process, instead of acknowledging the need for flexibility and the inevitability of unexpected changes.
Engineers who believe in the “right tool for the job” sometimes turn into process czars when they become tech leads, seeking out the right tool to solve all issues with planning, focus, time management, and prioritization.
Ironically, while “agile” is often implemented in a rigid way, the principles of the Agile Manifesto are a great summary of healthy process leadership: 
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

As a new tech lead, be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of communication or leadership gaps on your team.
As with many of the manager pitfalls, an obsession with process can be related to a fear of failure and a desire to control things to prevent the unexpected.

## How to Be a Great Tech Lead
### UNDERSTAND THE ARCHITECTURE
It’s almost impossible to lead projects well when you don’t understand the architecture you’re changing.
### BE A TEAM PLAYER
If you’re doing all of the interesting work yourself, stop. Working on the less exciting parts of the code base can teach you a lot about where the process is broken.
If you’re only doing the most boring work, stop that, too. it’s reasonable for you to take on some of the harder tasks.
You want to encourage others on your team to learn the entire system, and you want to give them chances to stretch themselves, but you needn’t always be self-sacrificing in what you choose to work on. Give yourself a fun task occasionally, as long as you know you have the time to do it well.

### LEAD TECHNICAL DECISIONS
not the same thing as being the person who makes all of them alone.
Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to others with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve.

### COMMUNICATE
Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team.
Instead of having every team member sit in a meeting, you represent the team, communicate their needs, and bring information from that meeting back to the team

Successful leaders write well, they read carefully, and they can get up in front of a group and speak.
. Now is a great time to practice your writing and speaking skills. Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience.

## Assessing Your Own Experience
* Does your organization have tech leads? Is there is a written job description for this role? If so, what does it say? If not, how would you define the role in your organization? How would a tech lead define the role? 
* If you are considering becoming a tech lead, are you ready to push yourself? Are you comfortable spending some of your time outside of the code? Do you feel like enough of an expert in your code base to successfully lead others as they work in it? 
* Have you asked your manager what he or she expects from the tech lead? 
* Who is the best tech lead you ever worked with? What are some things that person did that made him or her great?
* Have you worked with a frustrating tech lead? What did he or she do that frustrated you?

# 4 - Managing People
> [!quote] MARC HEDLUND
> New engineering managers think of the job as a promotion, giving them seniority on engineering tasks and questions. This is a great approach for ensuring they remain junior managers, and unsuccessful leaders at that. It’s hard to accept that “new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that’s the best mindset with which to start leading.
## Starting a New Reporting Relationship O Right
How do you get to know this person quickly so you can manage him best?
### BUILD TRUST AND RAPPORT
* How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
* What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it, or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback?
* Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about?
* How do I know when you’re in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?
* Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
* Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them?
* Any surprises since you’ve joined, good or bad, that I should know about?

### CREATE A 30/60/90-DAY PLAN
Another approach, create a 30/60/90-day plan.
This can include basic goals, like getting up to speed on the code, committing a bug fix, or performing a release, and is especially valuable for new hires and people transferring from other areas
The more senior the hire, the more he should participate in creating this plan.
Unfortunately, sometimes you will mishire a person. Having a clear set of expected goals for your new hires that you believe is achievable in the first 90 days will help you catch mishires quickly, and make it clear to you and to them that you need to correct the situation

### ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION BY UPDATING THE NEW HIRE DOCUMENTATION
For early- to mid-career hires, one aspect of onboarding will likely include contributing to the team’s onboarding documentation
He edits the documentation to reflect processes or tools that have changed since the last hire, or points that he found confusing.
you may be the person to get this process in place, and you’ll need to reinforce it for everyone who joins the team.

### COMMUNICATE YOUR STYLE AND EXPECTATIONS
Your new hire needs to understand your expectations and your style just as much as you need to understand his.
include specifics like how often you want to meet with him, how the two of you will share information, and when and how often you’ll want to review his work.
Help him understand how long he should work alone trying to solve a problem, and at what point he should ask for help. For some teams this might be an hour, and for others it might be a week.

### GET FEEDBACK FROM YOUR NEW HIRE
get as much feedback as you can about the new hire’s perspective on the team in that first 90 days. take their observations with the requisite grain of salt, and definitely don’t encourage people in this period to criticize the established processes or systems in a way that makes the existing team feel attacked.

## Communicating with Your Team
> [!quote] MARC HEDLUND
> Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time.

### HAVE REGULAR 1-1S
It is absolutely true that every person and team is different: they need different things, have different communication styles, and focus on different things. but if you’re not a CTO with years and years of management, you should probably start by assuming that you need to do regularly scheduled 1-1s.

### SCHEDULING 1-1S
The default scheduling for 1-1s is weekly.  adjust the frequency only if both of you agree that this is more than you need. When you meet less frequently, any missed 1-1s must be rescheduled, which is usually a drag on both of you.

### ADJUSTING 1-1S.
* *How often do you interact with this person offhand during the week?* If you interact with her frequently, you may not need a weekly set-aside time to chat
* *How much coaching does this person need?* 
* *How much does this person push information up to you?* A person who’s not good at pushing information up may need more face time to do so.
* *How good is your relationship with this person?* Don’t make the fatal error of spending all your time with your problem employees and ignoring your stars.
* *How stable or unstable are things in the team or the company?* Keeping your 1-1s regular through times of uncertainty will help stabilize your team and slow down the rumor mill.

### Dierent 1-1 Styles
#### THE TO-DO LIST MEETING
One or both parties comes in with a list of objectives to cover, and the parties cover these objectives in order of importance.
follows the “don’t waste time with pointless meetings” mandate
In general this style is very professional and efficient, if sometimes a bit cold.

#### THE CATCH-UP
My goal in a 1-1 is rst to listen to anything my direct reports want to discuss
if it’s left unchecked, it can turn into a complaining session or therapy
Empathetic leaders can sometimes allow themselves to get sucked into an unhealthy closeness with their direct reports.
There is very little value to repeatedly focusing on drama.

#### THE FEEDBACK MEETING
Sometimes your 1-1s will be devoted to informal feedback and coaching.
It’s good to hold these kinds of meetings at a regular interval, especially for your earlycareer employees. Quarterly is frequent enough to give the topic attention without it feeling like all you talk about is career development
If you have an employee with performance issues, feedback meetings should happen more frequently, and if you’re thinking of ring someone I advise you to document these feedback meetings.
when someone does something that needs immediate corrective feedback, don’t wait for the 1-1 to provide that feedback. . The same goes for praise

#### THE PROGRESS REPORT
you’re managing managers, a lot of your 1-1 meetings will be diving into details of projects they’re overseeing that you don’t have time to dig into on your own.
When you are managing only a handful of individuals, the only time you should be using a 1-1 to do progress reporting is when you have someone who’s o on a side project that you’re not personally overseeing.

#### GETTING TO KNOW YOU
Leave room to get to know the person reporting to you as a human being. Show that you are invested in helping them now and in the future.

#### MIX IT UP
For variety, you can do your 1-1s as walking meetings, or over coee or lunch to get out of the office. Just remember that when you’re not taking notes you’ll probably forget some important things
One nal piece of advice: try to keep notes in a shared document, with you the manager playing note taker. For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways, and to-dos from your 1-1s.

### Good Manager, Bad Manager: Micromanager, Delegator
A high-stress project that can’t be allowed to slip seems at risk, and so you step in to correct it. You force everyone to come to you before making decisions because they just can’t be trusted to do the right thing, or there have been too many mistakes and you always end up paying the price.
The hardest thing about micromanagement is that there are times when you need to do it. Junior engineers often thrive under detailed oversight because they want that specic direction.
Trust and control are the main issues around micromanagement. This happens a lot when talented engineers become managers, especially if they pride themselves on their technical skills.

Autonomy, the ability to have control over some part of your work, is an important element of motivation. This is why micromanagers nd it so difficult to retain great teams.
On the other hand, delegation is not the same thing as abdication. When you’re delegating responsibility, you’re still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help the project succeed.

## Practical Advice for Delegating Eectively
### USE THE TEAM’S GOALS TO UNDERSTAND WHICH DETAILS YOU SHOULD DIG INTO
When you feel like you want to micromanage, ask the team how they’re measuring their success and ask them to make that visible to you on an ongoing basis
if the team is making progress on its goals, the systems are stable, and the product manager is happy, I rarely dig into the details beyond a cursory overview.
When you are managing a team that doesn’t have a clear plan, use the details you’d want to monitor to help them create one.

### GATHER INFORMATION FROM THE SYSTEMS BEFORE GOING TO THE PEOPLE
The worst micromanagers are those who constantly ask for information they could easily get themselves. this information is just a piece of the context, not the whole picture, and it means nothing without the goals just discussed.

### ADJUST YOUR FOCUS DEPENDING ON THE STAGE OF PROJECTS
In the beginning and design stages of a project, you may want to be more involved in order to facilitate a good set of project goals or a good system design
When you’re close to a delivery date, progress details become more important, because there are more decisions to be made
During the normal workflow, though, it’s usually enough to know what’s moving forward and what is taking longer than expected

### ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR CODE AND SYSTEMS
Developing basic standards as a team helps everyone communicate with one another in code and design reviews, and it depersonalizes the process of providing technical feedback.

### TREAT THE OPEN SHARING OF INFORMATION, GOOD OR BAD, IN A NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE WAY
Jack is having a hard time with a project, but hasn’t been asking for help with his problems.. The goal here isn’t to punish him with micromanagement for his failure to communicate status, because all you’re doing is punishing yourself and hindering his ability to be held accountable for his own work
Instead, your goal is to teach Jack what he needs to communicate, when, and how
In the long run, if you don’t gure out how to let go of details, delegate, and trust your team, you’re likely to suer personally
Your time is too valuable to waste, and your team deserves a manager who is willing to trust them to do things on their own.

## Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback
If performance reviews make you shudder, you’re not alone. Unfortunately, the review process is not something that every manager takes seriously or handles in a mature way. Now that you’re managing people, you have a lot of power to shape the experience your direct reports have with reviews
That experience starts long before the reviews are written. It starts with continuous feedback. Continuous feedback is, more than anything, a commitment to regularly sharing both positive and corrective feedback.

training you to pay attention to individuals, which in turn makes it easier to recognize and foster talent. You’re also practicing the art of having small and occasionally tricky conversations with individuals about their performance.

1. **Know your people**: What are their goals, if any? What are their strengths and weaknesses? ask for his or her perspective on all of these questions
2. **Observe your people**: the eort forces you to start paying attention to the individuals on your team. Good managers have a knack for identifying talents and helping people draw more out of their strengths. Yes, you’ll also want to look for weaknesses and areas for improvement, but if you spend most of your time trying to get people to correct weaknesses, you’ll end up with a style that feels more like continuous criticism. Adopting a habit of positive recognition forces you to be on the lookout for things to praise
3. **Provide lightweight, regular feedback**: Start with positive feedback. It’s both easier and more fun to give positive feedback. Positive feedback also makes your reports more likely to listen to you when you need to give them critical feedback. Use a habit of continuous feedback to talk about things that don’t seem to be going well as you start to notice them
4. **Bonus: Provide coaching**: use coaching to ask people what they might have done dierently. make suggestions as to what could be even better in the future. here will be many times when you don’t have either the qualications or the capability to provide the coaching that everyone on your team needs. Coaching is most important for your earlycareer team members, or those who have the potential or desire for advancement.

## Performance Reviews
Continuous feedback is not a replacement for a more formal, 360-based performance review process.
The 360 model is a performance review that includes feedback from, in addition to a person’s manager, his teammates, anyone who reports to him, and MANAGING PEOPLE | 63 coworkers he regularly interacts with, as well as a self-review.

Performance reviews take a long time because you need to give and receive feedback from many dierent people. Performance reviews reward the time spent by providing a valuable chance to synthesize a bunch of information about a person

Writing the summary review gives you the chance to focus for longer than a few minutes on the individuals and look at the big picture over a longer period of time. All of this should help you see some patterns and trends that you might overlook in the process of day-to-day continuous feedback.

Performance reviews go wrong because people aren’t given time to prioritize working on them, and many people nd them hard to write. They go wrong because we tend to remember and overemphasize things that happened most recently, and forget about the things that happened six months or a year ago.

### WRITING AND DELIVERING A PERFORMANCE REVIEW
#### Give yourself enough time, and start early
plan to spend solid, uninterrupted time working on reviews

start by reading the collected reviews and taking a few notes, processing the information for a little bit before trying to write a full summary

#### Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months
One tactic is to keep a running summary of your 1-1s, including any feedback that was delivered. Recognize not just early accomplishments but also the growth and change you’ve seen since then.

#### Use concrete examples, and excerpts from peer reviews
Forcing yourself to be specic will steer you away from writing reviews based on underlying bias.

#### Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths
This goes not only for the writing process but also—and especially—for the delivery.
Don’t let people skip over the good stu in order to obsess over the areas for improvement, as many will want to do.

#### When it comes to areas for improvement, keep it focused
More often, you’ll get a lot of scattershot feedback that’s moderately helpful at best.
If the feedback seems valuable for the person to hear, share it, but don’t just blindly report all grudges.
What about the case where you have very little meaningful feedback for improvement? This indicates that the person is ready to be promoted or given more challenging work.

#### Avoid big surprises
Set expectations appropriately before reviews are delivered. If someone is underperforming across the board, the review should not be his rst time getting that feedback.

#### Schedule enough time to discuss the review
I usually give people a printed copy of the review as they’re leaving on the evening before the review is scheduled. This practice gives them a chance to read it at home, and then come to the meeting ready to talk about what it says
still take the time to go over each section, starting with the strengths and accomplishments.

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Identifying Potential
> A person who has never shown reasonable performance, and who has been with a company long enough for you to observe performance, probably doesn’t actually have potential, at least within that company. It doesn’t matter how good his school was, how articulate she is, how tall he is…
> . Potential, therefore, must be tied to actions and value produced.

## Cultivating Careers
If you’re a manager, you are going to play a key role in getting people on your team promoted. Sometimes it will simply be up to you to determine who gets promoted, but more commonly promotions will be reviewed by your management, or a committee. So you’ll not only need to have a good idea about who deserves to be promoted, but you’ll need to make a case for their promotion as well.

people fresh out of college tend to get promoted at least once in their rst couple of years on the job, because they’re often hired in at an “up or out” level.

The important thing for you to start doing now that you’re in management is to learn how the game is played at your company.
* How are these decisions made?
* How early do you need to start preparing packets (proofs of performance / actions that show the potential of the person)?
* Are there limits on the number of promotions that can happen in any given year?
be fairly transparent with your team.
You should also prepare yourself to start identifying promotion-worthy projects and trying to give those projects to people who are close to promotion.

This work does start to change the more senior your team becomes. Many people will not continue to advance past a certain level, at least not within the same company or team.

Many companies expect you to be acting at the next level before you get promoted to it. This practice exists to prevent the “Peter Principle,”

### Challenging Situations: Firing Underperformers
Upon hearing that someone is underperforming, many companies will have you write the person a document called a performance improvement plan. This is a set of clearly dened objectives that the person must achieve within a xed period of time.

Often the plan is written in such a way that the person can’t possibly hope to achieve the goals in the allotted time, and it’s just a generous way of giving someone time to look for another job before being red.

the process of coaching someone out should begin long before any performance improvement document is led with HR, and long before the actual act of ring.
One of the basic rules of management is the rule of no surprises, particularly negative ones.

start giving feedback early and often, and keep records of the feedback you’ve been delivering. Feedback, positive or negative, should be a conversation. If you avoid tackling negative feedback until it builds to a boiling point, you’re going to be met by a pile of excuses, and then what do you do?

Some managers will ignore the excuses at their peril, and lose employee after employee to an unwelcoming team that fails to onboard, coach, and give clear goals to employees. 
On the other hand, some managers will accept any excuse until problems can no longer be swept under the rug, and the team is furious at management’s inaction with regard to the lagging employee.

A nal warning: don’t put anyone on a plan whom you wouldn’t be happy to lose. Most smart employees will take this formal warning as a sign that the organization is not a good t for them, and leave as quickly as possible.

> [!question] Ask the CTO: Coaching Someone Out of the Company
> You have an employee who has topped out in the organization and seems to be losing energy. He has achieved expectations in his level, but can’t figure out how to grow enough to get to the next level, despite your eorts. It may be time to coach him out.
> Some people will be happy cruising as senior engineers or managers at a certain level for their whole careers, and if you’re both satisfied with the work, there’s nothing wrong with that.
> Others, like your employee, want to progress but for whatever reason don’t seem to be able to do it on your team. Make the situation clear to him. This is what is meant by “coaching out.”
> You aren’t firing him, but you are telling him that he needs to move on if he wants to progress. Give the employee a chance to find a job in another part of the organization or at another company. When he does, let him go happily, and do your best to retain goodwill.

## Assessing Your Own Experience
* Have you set up regular 1-1s with your direct reports?
* When was the last time you talked to your reports about their career development? If it was more than three months ago, can you make sure to put this in your next 1-1s?
* Have you given feedback to your reports in the last week? When was the last time you handed out kudos in front of the team?
* When was the last time someone behaved in a way that needed correction? How long did it take you to give corrective feedback? Did you give the feedback in private, or did you do it in public?
* Have you ever been given a performance review that felt like a waste of time? What was it missing that could have made it more valuable?
* What was the most useful piece of performance feedback you ever got? How was it delivered to you?
* Do you know how the process of promoting people works in your company? If not, can you ask someone to walk you through it?

# 5 - Managing a team
Managing a team is more than just doing the job of managing the individuals.
