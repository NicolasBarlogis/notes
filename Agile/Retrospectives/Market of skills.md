1.  Each team member is asked to draw up a personal skills market stall as part of a team skills marketplace
2.  The top of the counter is where they should make note of all of the relevant skills they currently bring to the team
3.  Underneath the counter is where they should make notes of any ‘hidden’ skills they have: this could be abilities they used for previous roles or careers, or maybe in their spare time or as a hobby. Depending on the team and the aim of the session you can ask them to keep them professional or allow them to include anything they want to share
4.  They should also make a note (perhaps on different coloured post-it notes) of any skills they would like to learn or improve
