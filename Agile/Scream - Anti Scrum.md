## Definition of Scream
Scream (n): A framework within which the organisation creates a facade that looks like they are doing Scrum, without solving any meaningful problems. Scream provides an illusion of “Agile”, gives managers the feeling that everything is under strict control, fosters unrealistic expectations and bullies developers into unethical and unsustainable development practices. 

Scream is:
-   Lightweight
-   Easy to do
-   Difficult to get rid of

# Uses of Scream
Scream was initially developed for managing and controlling development teams. Starting with the beginning of professional software development, Scream has been used extensively, worldwide, to: 

1.  Constrain teams and maintain the illusion of control;
2.  Increase project outcome predictability (you will fail);
3.  Simplify talent management (talent leaves fast);
4.  Selling off sustainability for quick wins;
5.  Provide a badge of merit on the CV of managers preparing their next career move; and
6.  Preserve and cement the organisational status quo
