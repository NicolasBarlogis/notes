When you feel stuck because you don’t understand what the code is doing, here’s what you can do:

1.  **Take a breath**, there is a way out and you’re about to find it
2.  **Reset your git status** to start fresh (`git reset --hard` or `git stash` will do)
3.  **Set up a timer** for 30 minutes
4.  **Refactor the code freely**, don’t worry if the code still compiles, just go ahead and change it
5.  **Throw away your changes** when the timer rings! Just do it: `git reset --hard`
6.  **Take a break**, go drink some water and _think_ about what you just learned

This is described by Michael Feathers as “Exploratory Refactoring” in [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/key-points-of-working-effectively-with-legacy-code).

It’s not really a refactoring process, but a learning one. Your goal here is to **understand Legacy Code**.
