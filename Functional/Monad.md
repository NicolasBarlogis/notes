Quelques monades classiques:
-   `Nullable<T>` — represents a T that could be null
-   `Func<T>` — represents a T that can be computed on demand
-   `Lazy<T>` — represents a T that can be computed on demand once, then cached
-   `Task<T>` — represents a T that is being computed asynchronously and will be available in the future, if it isn’t already
-   `IEnumerable<T>` — represents an ordered, read-only sequence of zero or more Ts
