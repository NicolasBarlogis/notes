The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. Some people call this the test context.

Examples of fixtures:

-   Loading a database with a specific, known set of data
-   Erasing a hard disk and installing a known clean operating system installation
-   Copying a specific known set of files
-   Preparation of input data and set-up/creation of fake or mock objects
